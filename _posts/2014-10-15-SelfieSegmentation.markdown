### Xinlei's segmentation

So finally I could run Xinlei's segmentation on a small part of my selfie dataset.  
I ran it for ~240 images from 'Indian girl selfie' images off google images.  
The results are [here](http://pyrie.vmr.cs.cmu.edu/~rohit/projects/003_SelfieSegmentation/results/001_Vanilla_IndianGirls200/mini/indian_girl/publish/selfies-indian_girl-200/s001.html).
